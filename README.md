#Jetbrains recently announced a plan to switch to a subscription based model

Dear Jetbrains,

I am writing to express my thorough disappointment with the decision for Jetbrains to switch to a subscription based model.

While I understand the need for businesses to monetize, I feel that this monetization strategy is completely over looking the needs and desires of your historically loyal user base. I could understand this decision if your products were serviced-based or hosted (i.e. cloud) solutions, but as a stand-alone, desktop software this decision only serves to benefit one party.

Not only are you questioning historically loyal users by continuously asking them to show their support for your product, you are literally devaluing your product by requiring me to repurchase it on a recurring basis. No longer do I have the option to purchase a high-value, life long, perpetual license for your product. I do not understand how Jetbrains can drag themselves to the ranks of often, lackluster subscription based software.

I have long been a loyal and vocal advocate for Jetbrains software and customer service. Your software does make my job easier and I do enjoy using it. Your customer support and involvement with your loyal community has long been top notch. I often go out of my way to explain why I love using your products, like Webstorm and PHPStorm, and have convinced many people to switch to Jetbrains. After this decision, I have no desire to continue advocating your historically incredible software and intend to make it very clear to potential users of how you’ve decided to treat loyal users.

This decision shows a lack of empathy for the community you have worked so hard to build and I am extremely concerned about your future considerations of myself and the rest of the community. Unless Jetbrains decides to amend this new policy with consideration for traditional, perpetual based licenses, I will no longer be purchasing new offerings. I will use the current version of software. When I feel they are no longer suitable for use, I will look for alternatives offering perpetual licenses or simply use a text editor.

I hope Jetbrains can recognize the error of their ways and address this issue in response to the community. I want to continue enjoying your products and advocating for a historically incredible brand.

A smart and simple plugin that provides keyboard shortcut access for Dash, Velocity or Zeal in IntelliJ IDEA, RubyMine, WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm and Android Studio.

[![Flattr this](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](http://flattr.com/thing/2558535/gdelmasIntelliJDashPlugin-on-GitHub)

## Installation
To install the plugin in your IDE go to **Preferences -> Plugins -> Browse repositories** and **search for "Dash"**.

## Usage
The default **shortcut** assigned to search is **Cmd-Shift-D** (Mac OS X) or **Ctrl-Shift-D** (Windows, Linux). 


A **menubar command** named either "**Search in Dash**" (Mac OS X), "Search in Velocity" (Windows) or "Search in Zeal" (Linux) can be found in the "Tools" menu.


The plugin either searches for the statement at caret position or the current selection. It will identify the programming language in use and request filtered results accordingly.

## Configuration
### Shortcut
You can change the shortcut at Preferences -> Keymap -> Plug-ins -> Dash.

### Toolbar Icon
You can add a "Search in Dash/Velocity/Zeal" button to the toolbar. Right-click the menubar -> Customize […]. You will find the button under "Plug-ins -> Dash".

## Supported API Documentation Browsers
### Kapeli Dash (Mac OS X)
Dash is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager. Dash stores snippets of code and instantly searches offline documentation sets for 150+ APIs (for a full list, see below). You can even generate your own docsets or request docsets to be included.

## Troubleshooting
######The plugin does not work on old IDEs
Older IDE versions like **AppCode 1.x** are not supported anymore. Please manually install version 2.2 of the plugin: https://github.com/gdelmas/IntelliJDashPlugin/releases/tag/2.2

######In rare conditions the installation from the repositories does not work
It looks like there is an IntelliJ/Java bug with OS X Mavericks which prevents to install plugins from the repositories. Please install the plugin manually from [here](https://github.com/gdelmas/IntelliJDashPlugin/releases). For additional information check [issue #13](https://github.com/gdelmas/IntelliJDashPlugin/issues/13).
